//! ARM axpy kernels, one set per core, built into the per-core kernel objects
//! (`src/linalg/blas/_kernel.zig`), and how they get installed into the
//! vtable (`install`): cores without an entry keep the portable kernels from
//! `axpy.installGeneric`. Per-core tests live in `axpy/__root__.zig`, not
//! here -- they need the full axpy interface (`checkReal`, ...), which
//! imports outside `src/linalg/blas/` and so cannot appear in this file (see
//! `kernels/__root__.zig`).
//!
//! The kernels that are assembly upstream are in `asm/`, one Zig file per
//! source and precision with its `#if`s and macros resolved (`asm/__root__.zig`
//! says which core uses which). A core whose reference kernel is C keeps the
//! portable kernels until that is ported.
